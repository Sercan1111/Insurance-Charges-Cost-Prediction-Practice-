# Insurance Cost Prediction

## Overview
This project involves predicting insurance costs using a dataset that includes various attributes of insurance holders. The project uses data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and linear regression modeling to predict insurance charges. The solution is implemented in Python, utilizing libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, and matplotlib.

## Dataset
- insurance.csv: The dataset contains attributes related to insurance policyholders such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, region, and charges.

## Preprocessing Steps
1. Data Loading:
2. Data Cleaning:
3. Outlier Detection and Removal:
4. Dropping Unnecessary Columns:

## Regression Model
--Linear Regression
-Model Training:
Train a linear regression model on the training data.
-Model Evaluation:
Evaluate model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score.
Visualize the relationship between actual and predicted charges.

## Files in the Repository
- insurance_cost_prediction.py: The main Python script with all the preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and evaluation steps.
- requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies to run the script.
- insurance.csv: The dataset used for this project.

## Results
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): Indicates the average squared difference between the actual and predicted charges.
- R-squared (R²) Score: Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
- Visualized the relationship between actual and predicted insurance charges.
## Future Work
- Explore more advanced regression techniques and models to improve prediction accuracy.
-Implement additional feature engineering techniques.
- Integrate the models into a real-time prediction system for practical use.
